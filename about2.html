            <p>
                I work for Pitt IT - Client Services at the University of Pittsburgh. Through my work I have developd
                an acute sense for problem solving and communication. On the job I am presented with problems. I brake down every into componet parts. Then I analyze the parts and leverage a network of experts to solve each smaller problem. This is the process I have become accustomed to whilst building my own cache of knowledge and becoming an expert in my own right.
            </p>

            <p>
                One area that I have become a leader in is our Jamf support. Jamf is a management framework for Apple computers and devices. I meet regularly with a dedicated team to improve our services. We also hold weekly educational meetings so that the whole team can advance their knowledge. Therefore we are a stronger, more resilient team.

                Besides work I have many hobbies including biking, playing synthesizers, and traveling. Biking because I value excercise. Synthesizers for creative expression. Traveling to get fresh perspectives.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have always enjoyed biking, and recently I have increased my participation in the community by volunteering at bike coop called Free Ride.
                I share a lot of values with Free Ride including community, diy repair, and volunteering. It exists in an anti-consumerist framework.
                I enjoy biking to work, and also on Pennsylvania's Great Allegheny Passage trail. My goal is to bike all 300 miles of it this coming year.
            </p>

            <p>
                With a seamless connection, my technical skills and creative interests harmoniously converge on synthesizers. 
            </p>
             
            <p>
                I started traveling more as an adult. Through my experiences I have gained friends all over the world. 
                I hope to have a job one day that allows me the freedom to visit them as often as i would like!
            </p>
