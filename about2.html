            <p>
                I am currently employed at Pitt IT - Client Services at the University of Pittsburgh. 
                Through my work, I have cultivated a keen aptitude for problem-solving and effective communication. 
                In my role, I encounter various challenges that I meticulously deconstruct into their component parts. 
                I then analyze these parts and tap into a network of experts to address each specific issue. 
                This process has become second nature to me, enabling me to accumulate a wealth of knowledge and
                 establish myself as an IT professional.</p>

            <p>
                One domain in which I have emerged as a leader is Jamf support. 
                Jamf serves as a management framework for Apple computers and devices. 
                As part of a dedicated team, I regularly collaborate to enhance our Jamf services. 
                We also conduct weekly educational sessions to collectively advance our expertise. 
                This synergy fortifies our team, making us more resilient and capable.            
            </p>

            <p>
                Beyond my professional commitments, I nurture several hobbies including biking, playing synthesizers, and exploring new destinations. 
                Biking serves as my physical outlet, synthesizers as my medium of creative expression, and traveling as a means to gain fresh perspectives.            
            </p>

            <p>
                Biking has long been a passion of mine, and recently, I've deepened my engagement in the community by volunteering at the bike co-op, Free Ride. 
                I share many values with Free Ride, including a strong sense of community, a commitment to DIY repair, and a dedication to volunteer work. 
                My daily bike commute and rides along Pennsylvania's Great Allegheny Passage trail invigorate me, and my ambition is to conquer its entire 300-mile stretch in the coming year.
            </p>

            <p>
                The seamless fusion of my technical skills and creative inclinations finds its perfect harmony in synthesizers. 
                I've had the privilege of performing with a live band using synthesizers and more recently, as a solo artist. 
            </p>
             
            <p>
                My exploration of travel started in adulthood, leading to the cultivation of friendships around the world. 
                <!-- I aspire to one day secure a job that affords me the freedom to visit these friends as frequently as I desire! -->
             </p>
